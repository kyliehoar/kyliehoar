Algorithms covered in each folder:

hw_1 - 
ComputeRectangle - This method must return a Location object which records the (startr,startc,r,c) of the rectangle that you found within the EmbeddedRectangle

DigitRepresentation - This function will construct a stack containing the digits (in base b) of n in reverse order such that the topmost value on the returned stack will be the leftmost digit representation of n in base b

EmpiricalEvaluation - Produce a table that counts the number of multiplications/divisions and additions/subtractions within: MatrixMultiply, Strassen, DeterminantMatrix

Evaluate - Implementation of a calculator algorithm using two stacks to evaluate an expression, invented by Dijkstra

SolveSearch - Given a TwoDimensionalStorage that contains a Permutation Array, compute the number of values in each row that are lesser than a specific value

StackConverter - Take a stack of values and return an array of those values, in order from oldest to youngest, while ensuring that when done the original stack is reconstituted as it was

Staque - Create a Staque class, which is a unique structure that uses a single char array to provide both Stack and Queue behaviors

Strassen - Utilized for EmpiricalEvaluation

hw_2 - 
Analysis - Given the following proc function, let S(N) be the number of times power(base, exp) is invoked when calling proc(A, 0, n-1) on an array, A, of length n containing integer values from 0 to n-1

Memory - Responsible for allocating memory from within a designated block of chars

StressProgram - Sanity check for Memory Class

Tournament - You will instrument this class to accumulate the total number of comparisons between two integers (using less) and the total number of exchanges of two elements (using exch)

ValidateMemory - Connects to Memory Class

hw_3 - 
BST - Implement special functions into BST class to expand its functionalities

MaxPQ - Utilize this class for MergeMaxPQ

MergeMaxPQ - Given two max heaps of size M and N, devise an algorithm that returns an array of size M + N containing the combined items from M and N in ascending order

TestBST - Test the BST class

TrialST - Use the following domain to evaluate the performance of these different ST implementations in terms of the number of times equals() is called

hw_4 - 
Connected - Answers the question: Is it possible to use a single airline carrier (either Delta or Southwest Airlines) and start from Boston Logan Airport (whose ICAO code is “KBOS”) and fly to every other airport (using any number of connecting flights) in that carrier’s network by only using that carrier?

Delta - Outputs data for all Delta flights

FilterLower48 - Class that only accept airports that are in the country “United States” and whose GPS coordinates are within the bounding box of allowed GPS coordinates

FlightStats - Find the longest and shortest direct flights for both Delta and Southwest by computing GPS distance

Histogram - output histogram data for a raw output and summary outputs with 2 different bin sizes (1 and 5)

Hub - If a hub means an airport that is connected to more than 75 other airports, then this airport prints for each airline the ICAO code for each of its hubs together with the number of flights at that hub (in no particular order)

LongestOfShortest - find the all-pairs, shortest distance over the network graphs for each carrier and determine the maximal of these shortest paths – that is, a pair of airports for which the total accumulated distance (when trying to compute the shortest path between these airports) is larger than any other pair of airports in the network.

MapSearch - analyze Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, and Dijkstra’s Single Source Shortest Path algorithm for a set of highway mapping data

Overlap - determines those United States airports in the Lower 48 states that are served by Southwest Airlines but not by Delta Airlines

Southwest - Outputs data for all Southwest flights
