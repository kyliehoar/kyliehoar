Hello!
  My name is Kylie Hoar, and I am an undergraduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. I am currently 
  pursuing a Bachelors in Data Science, and a Bachelors in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. I am actively seeking full-time
  employment after my graduation in May 2025, and would love to chat! Attached to my main repo are topic-specific coding projects.
  
  Feel free to email me at kyliehoar10@gmail.com for any inquiries.
