Machine Learning topics covered in each file:

  Assignment_1 - parameter/coefficient analysis and pairplot development

  Assignment_2 - linear regression, diagnostic plotting (fitted vs. residual and standardized residual, qq plot, and leverage vs. standardized residual), and scaling variables to observe changes in t-value

  Assignment_3 - logistic regression, accuracy score, confusion matrices, LDA, QDA, and KNN

  Assignment_4 - leave one out cross validation, best coefficient subset identification (CP, BIC, R^2), forward and backward stepwise models, lasso cross validation, and coefficient estimation/optimization

  Assignment_5 - polynomial regression, random forest classification, decision tree regression and bagging regression for optimization (best subsets), and random forest regression

  Assignment_6 - support vector classifiers/modeling/machine, SVC kernel manipulation, SVM plotting, hierarchical clustering, dendrograms

  hw_4 - utilizing logistic regression, KNN, and random forest to predict what numbers are being displayed by visual images of numbers on a black background
