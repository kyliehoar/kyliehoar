Algorithms covered in each folder:

hw_1 - 
ComputeRectangle - This method must return a Location object which records the (startr,startc,r,c) of the rectangle that you found within the EmbeddedRectangle
DigitRepresentation - This function will construct a stack containing the digits (in base b) of n in reverse order such that the topmost value on the returned stack will be the leftmost digit representation of n in base b.
EmpiricalEvaluation - Produce a table that counts the number of multiplications/divisions and additions/subtractions within: MatrixMultiply, Strassen, DeterminantMatrix
Evaluate - Implementation of a calculator algorithm using two stacks to evaluate an expression, invented by Dijkstra
SolveSearch - Given a TwoDimensionalStorage that contains a Permutation Array, compute the number of values in each row that are lesser than a specific value.
StackConverter - Take a stack of values and return an array of those values, in order from oldest to youngest, while ensuring that when done the original stack is reconstituted as it was
Staque - Create a Staque class, which is a unique structure that uses a single char array to provide both Stack and Queue behaviors
Strassen - Utilized for EmpiricalEvaluation

hw_2 - 
Analysis - Given the following proc function, let S(N) be the number of times power(base, exp) is invoked when calling proc(A, 0, n-1) on an array, A, of length n containing integer values from 0 to n-1
Memory - Responsible for allocating memory from within a designated block of chars
StressProgram - Sanity check for Memory Class
Tournament - You will instrument this class to accumulate the total number of comparisons between two integers (using less) and the total number of exchanges of two elements (using exch)
ValidateMemory - Connects to Memory Class

hw_3 - 
BST - Implement special functions into BST class to expand its functionalities
MaxPQ - Utilize this class for MergeMaxPQ
MergeMaxPQ - Given two max heaps of size M and N, devise an algorithm that returns an array of size M + N containing the combined items from M and N in ascending order
TestBST - Test the BST class
TrialST - Use the following domain to evaluate the performance of these different ST implementations in terms of the number of times equals() is called

hw_4 - 
Connected - 
Delta - Outputs data for all Delta flights
FilterLower48 - Class that only accept airports that are in the country “United States” and whose GPS coordinates are within the bounding box of allowed GPS coordinates
FlightStats - 
Histogram - output histogram data for a raw output and summary outputs with 2 different bin sizes (1 and 5)
Hub - 
LongestOfShortest - 
MapSearch - 
Overlap - 
Southwest - Outputs data for all Southwest flights
